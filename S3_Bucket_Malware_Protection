S3 Bucket Setup/Malware Protection
Overview: This project demonstrates how to secure an Amazon S3 bucket using GuardDuty Malware Protection, AWS CloudTrail, 
and set up notifications for any potential threats or activity changes. 
The setup includes real-time alerts for malware detection and logging of API events.



1.  Set up the S3 Bucket
* I had to create an S3 Bucket with the correct settings such as what region, versioning, and encryption.
* MAKE SURE THE BUCKET IS NOT PUBLIC AND NO ONE HAS PUBLIC ACCESS!
* After that I had to create a new user who had the proper IAM roles to access the bucket.

2. Set up the AWS transfer family so I was able to use SFTP for any EC2 instances or for uploading via FileZilla
* I set up the AWS transfer family server made for SFTP with a publicly accessible endpoint 
* Create an SFTP user with the correct roles. Had to create a new policy for the user
* Also created an SSH key so I had secure access


3. Enable GuardDuty for Malware Protection
* Now I had to enable GuardDuty for malware protection and analysis
* I configured GuardDuty to track any event logs from CloudTrain
* Also had GuardDuty track read/write logs into the S3 bucket and check them for malware

4. Set up AWS SNS
* Now what's the point of a malware/anomaly service if it doesn't notify me when anomalies are found?
* Thats why I set up a SNS topic to send me any GuardDuty Findings
